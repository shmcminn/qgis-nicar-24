Title: Median Income in the Past 12 Months (in 2022 Inflation-Adjusted Dollars)

Notes
=============================================================================================================

Between 2018 and 2019 the American Community Survey retirement income question changed. These changes resulted in an increase in both the number of households reporting retirement income and higher aggregate retirement income at the national level. For more information see <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/technical-documentation/user-notes/2020-01.html\">Changes to the Retirement Income Question<\/a> .<br/><br/>

Information about the American Community Survey (ACS) can be found on the <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs.html\">ACS website<\/a>. Supporting documentation including code lists, subject definitions, data accuracy, and statistical testing, and a full list of ACS tables and table shells (without estimates) can be found on the <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/technical-documentation/code-lists.html\">Technical Documentation<\/a> section of the ACS website.<br /><br />Sample size and data quality measures (including coverage rates, allocation rates, and response rates) can be found on the American Community Survey website in the <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/acs/www/methodology/sample_size_and_data_quality/\">Methodology<\/a> section.<br/><br/>

Although the American Community Survey (ACS) produces population, demographic and housing unit estimates, the decennial census is the official source of population totals for April 1st of each decennial year. In between censuses, the Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program produces and disseminates the official estimates of the population for the nation, states, counties, cities, and towns and estimates of housing units for states and counties.<br/><br/>

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Data are based on a sample and are subject to sampling variability. The degree of uncertainty for an estimate arising from sampling variability is represented through the use of a margin of error. The value shown here is the 90 percent margin of error. The margin of error can be interpreted roughly as providing a 90 percent probability that the interval defined by the estimate minus the margin of error and the estimate plus the margin of error (the lower and upper confidence bounds) contains the true value. In addition to sampling variability, the ACS estimates are subject to nonsampling error (for a discussion of nonsampling variability, see <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/technical-documentation.html\">ACS Technical Documentation<\/a>). The effect of nonsampling error is not represented in these tables.<br/><br/>

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Estimates of urban and rural populations, housing units, and characteristics reflect boundaries of urban areas defined based on 2020 Census data. As a result, data for urban and rural areas from the ACS do not necessarily reflect the results of ongoing urbanization.<br/><br/>

The 2018-2022 American Community Survey (ACS) data generally reflect the March 2020 Office of Management and Budget (OMB) delineations of metropolitan and micropolitan statistical areas. In certain instances, the names, codes, and boundaries of the principal cities shown in ACS tables may differ from the OMB delineation lists due to differences in the effective dates of the geographic entities.<br/><br/>
